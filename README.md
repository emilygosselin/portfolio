### Hello and welcome to my coding porfolio!

<img align="right" src="IMG_5250.jpeg" width="200"/>

My name is Emily and I am in my third year of neuroscience at Dalhousie University. I only began coding a couple months ago and have learned a lot since then, which I hope can be demonstrated here. I have enjoyed the challenging problem-solving involved in coding and I look forward to continuing to learn and update my portfolio with newly acquired skills.
