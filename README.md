## Hello and welcome to my coding portfolio!

My name is Emily, my pronouns are she/her, and I am in my third year of neuroscience at Dalhousie University. I only began coding a couple months ago and have learned a lot since then, which I hope can be demonstrated here. I have enjoyed the challenging problem-solving involved in coding and I look forward to continuing to learn and acquire new skills.

>
> **Combining and Visualizing Two DataFrames**
>> To add onto the dataset [from above](convert.md), I combined it with another dataset and visualized the new combined DataFrame using [this code](combine.md).
>
> **Making Statements about the Data**
>> I created [these statements](state.md) about the dataset [above](combine.md) to help readers understand some key points of my data.
