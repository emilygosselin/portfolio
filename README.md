### Hello and welcome to my coding porfolio!

<img align="right" src="IMG_5250.jpeg" width="200"/>

My name is Emily and I am in my third year of neuroscience at Dalhousie University. I only began coding a couple months ago and have learned a lot since then, which I hope can be demonstrated here. I have enjoyed the challenging problem-solving involved in coding and I look forward to continuing to learn and acquire new skills.

If you would like to get in contact with me please email [EmilyGosselin8@gmail.com](mailto:emilygosselin8@gmail.com)

#### Convering a Dictionary to a DataFrame
Here is some [code I wrote](Converting Dictionary to DataFrame.md) to create and convert a data set I could work on.

#### Visualizing a DataFrame
This is [code I wrote](Visualizing Data.md) to visualize the dataset (from above) in a bar chart.

#### Combining and Visualizing Two DataFrames
To add onto the dataset (from above), I combined it with another dataset and visualized the new combined DataFrame using [this code](Combining and Visualizing.md).

#### Making Statements about the Data
I created [these statements](Making Statements.md) about the dataset (from above) to help readers understand some key points of my data.
