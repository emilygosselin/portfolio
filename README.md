## Hello and welcome to my coding portfolio!

<img align="right" src="IMG_5250.jpeg" width="250"/>

My name is Emily, my pronouns are she/her, and I am in my third year of neuroscience at Dalhousie University. I only began coding a couple months ago and have learned a lot since then, which I hope can be demonstrated here. I have enjoyed the challenging problem-solving involved in coding and I look forward to continuing to learn and acquire new skills.

#### Creating, Combining, and Visualizing a Data Set 
>
> **Converting a Dictionary to a DataFrame**
>> Here is some [code I wrote](/heights/convert.md) to create and convert a data set I could work on.
>
> **Visualizing a DataFrame**
>> This is [code I wrote](heights/visual.md) to visualize the dataset [from above](heights/convert.md) in a bar chart.
>
> **Combining and Visualizing Two DataFrames**
>> To add onto the dataset [from above](heights/convert.md), I combined it with another dataset and visualized the new combined DataFrame using [this code](heights/combine.md).
>
> **Making Statements about the Data**
>> I created [these statements](heights/state.md) about the dataset [above](heights/combine.md) to help readers understand some key points of my data.

#### Working with MRI Data
>
> **Visualizing MRI Data**
>> Here is some [code](/masking/MRIdata.md) going through how to import and visualize MRI data using ImageIO.
>
> **Masking**
>> Here, I go through how to [mask](masking/brainmask.md) from the MRI data [above](masking/MRIdata.md).
