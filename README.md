## Hello and welcome to my coding portfolio!

<img align="right" src="IMG_5250.jpeg" width="250"/>

My name is Emily, my pronouns are she/her, and I am in my third year of neuroscience at Dalhousie University. I only began coding a couple months ago and have learned a lot since then, which I hope can be demonstrated here. I have enjoyed the challenging problem-solving involved in coding and I look forward to continuing to learn and acquire new skills.

#### Converting and Visualizing Data
Here is an [example](Creating and Converting Data.md) of how data can be converted from a dictionary to a dataframe, then visualized using bar charts.

#### Converting a Dictionary to a DataFrame
Here is some [code I wrote](Converting Dictionary to DataFrame.md) to create and convert a data set I could work on.

#### Visualizing a DataFrame
This is [code I wrote](Visualizing Data.md) to visualize the dataset [from above](Converting Dictionary to DataFrame.md) in a bar chart.

#### Combining and Visualizing Two DataFrames
To add onto the dataset [from above](Visualizing Data.md), I combined it with another dataset and visualized the new combined DataFrame using [this code](Combining and Visualizing.md).

#### Making Statements about the Data
I created [these statements](Statements.md) about the dataset [above](Combining and Visualizing.md) to help readers understand some key points of my data.
